// One use of TDD at the server level is to ensure that the HTTP status codes are returned as expected. Verifying status codes provide the most basic level of confidence that the server is functioning correctly. Having a test suite that includes status codes provides a quick check when implementing a new feature that we havenâ€™t accidentally caused a request for valid routes to respond not authorized (401) or not found (404). (Full list of status codes at httpstatuses.com)
// ex: assert.equal(response.status, 200);
